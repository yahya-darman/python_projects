# Inventory-Optimization-Model
This project focuses on optimizing inventory management through a Python-based model. The model aims to improve reorder levels, reduce excess inventory, and achieve a balanced inventory turnover ratio. By implementing the model's recommendations, significant cost savings were realized during an internship.
